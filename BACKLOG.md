# Backlog

Follow-up work that a change deliberately left out. Each item becomes its own specclaw proposal.

- [ ] **Promote an opportunity from chat** (from 043). `promote_opportunity` makes three writes: presales' claim, delivery's create under its own key, then the link. It can't be one keyed chat write, so it declares `service: null` and no longer becomes a confirm card. Before 043 every chat confirm of it ended "unknown". Make promote one service whose `run` calls the claim, the create and the link as nested commands, then declare it.
